Be aware, this is an old project for unity 2018.1 that ported to unity 2019.3, something may not work.<br />
There is a very little documentation made with Doxygen in Russian, search for "index.html" in "Documentation" folder.<br />
Some comments are in russian.<br />
Some code may be stupid :)<br />
